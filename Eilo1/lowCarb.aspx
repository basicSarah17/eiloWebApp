        The low-carb diet is a dietary approach that restricts the intake of carbohydrates 
        while emphasizing foods high in protein and healthy fats.
        By limiting carbohydrates, the body is encouraged to burn fat for fuel instead of relying on glucose from carbs.
        This approach can lead to weight loss, improved blood sugar control, and increased satiety. 
        Foods commonly consumed on a low-carb diet include meat, fish, eggs, nuts, seeds, non-starchy vegetables, and healthy fats like avocados and olive oil. 
        However, it's essential to choose nutrient-dense foods and monitor portion sizes to ensure balanced nutrition while following a low-carb diet.
